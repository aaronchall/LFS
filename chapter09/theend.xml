  <para>Well done! The new LFS system is installed! We wish you much
  success with your shiny new custom-built Linux system.</para>

  <para>It is a good idea to create an <filename>/etc/os-release</filename>
  file. By having this file, it is very easy for you (and for us if you need to
  ask for help at some point) to find out which LFS version is installed on the
  system. Create this file by running:</para>

<screen><userinput>cat &gt; /etc/os-release &lt;&lt; "EOF"
NAME="Linux From Scratch"
VERSION="&version;"
ID=lfs
PRETTY_NAME="Linux From Scratch &version;"
EOF</userinput></screen>
